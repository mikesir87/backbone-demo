# Backbone.js demo

This project uses a simple todo list, converts it to use Backbone, and then finally introduces RequireJS.

## Project Structure

- **basic** - the basic webapp without using any Javascript MVC framework
- **with-backbone** - adding Backbone.js to the mix by defining models and views
- **with-requirejs** - moving the various Backbone pieces into separate files (modules) and loading them using RequireJS
